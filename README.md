The above project is a complete smart contract developed on the SUI blockchain using Rust and the Move programming language.".  The smart contract is designed to integrate with MTN mobile money, a popular payment method in Africa, to enable users to buy and sell Stilla tokens directly from their mobile money wallets.

The smart contract includes functionality for transferring tokens, setting transfer fees, burning tokens, and pausing transfers if necessary.

To ensure security and prevent unauthorized access, the smart contract includes measures such as role-based access control and transaction validation. Additionally, the smart contract includes minting functions and transfer restrictions to ensure the integrity of the token economy.
